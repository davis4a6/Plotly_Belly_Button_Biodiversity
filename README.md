# Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity

Built an interactive dashboard using JavaScript and Plotly.js to experiment with and visualize data on the human belly button biodiversity.

# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

You can visit the Plotly Belly button Biodiversity dashboard here.

# Project Overview

This project consists of a dynamice and interactive visualization dashboard as well as three charts using Plotly. There is a human belly button biodiversity dataset that was used. The charts display bacteria that lives inside of the human body, specifically the belly button. When the user selects an id number in the pull down list, the metadata connected to that id will be displayed. The top ten bacteria samples will also be displayed in a pie chart as well as a bubble chart. 

# Results

Here is a snapshot of the interactive dashboard that can also be launched through GitHub Pages.
